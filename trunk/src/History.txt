rev 129
Added History.txt to repository

rev 128
PanoSaladoLoadMeter: fixed bug with multiple loads simultaneously that would leave meter at less than 100% when it should have been at 100%

rev 127
PS: fixed another bug introduced fixing the previous bug with removeSpace function

rev 126
InteractiveSceneManager: made enterFrame listener weak.

rev 125
PS: fixed bug in removeLastSpace (and in InteractiveSceneManager in PV)
LoadMeter: fixed bug with calculating percentage for multiple loads simultaneously

rev 124
Added openURL function callable from the XML: 
onClick="openURL:http://somewhere.com,_blank" 
UNTESTED, please give feedback.

rev 121
Attempted fix for null reference error when calling removeLastSpace that was located in Papervision:InteractiveSceneManager. 

rev 120
Fixed bug with hotspot sizing.  The sizing is not 100% accurate, but it is close, the multiplier just needs slight further adjustment.  Also moved stringToBoolean into a static method.

rev 119
PanoSaladoLoadMeter: Fixed drawing bug.

rev 118
PanoSaladoLoadMeter: created load metering module for all loading.
ModuleLoader: modified for use with PanoSaladoLoadMeter.
PanoSalado: modified for use with PanoSaladoLoadMeter.

rev 117
Canvas3D: fixed bug with not resizing on Fullscreen.
ModuleLoader: added IOError trace if XML not found.

rev 116
PanoSalado: moved stageQuality attribute to spaces tag in XML.
FlexUserInterface: created class PanoSaladoCanvas3D with the extra items Canvas3D needed to interact with PanoSalado.  Now you can add PanoSaladoCanvas3D components with no additional mx:script tag.

Added XML Schema.txt which is unfinished documentation on the XML format.

rev 113
Adding new, better Flex user interface example: FlexUserInterface.mxml, which incorporates PanoSalado's display sprites into a Flex component in the user interface called of type Canvas3D.  Thanks to Xero at fontvir.us for the Canvas3D class.

rev 102
Papervision: fix for onClick not working in conjunction with onOver and onOut.

rev 101
PanoSalado: change function syntax now uses dot syntax: "change:object.property=value"

rev 100
PanoSalado: preliminary support for a change function that sets attributes like alpha or visible of objects (hotspots, cubes, spheres, etc).

rev 99
PanoSalado: fixed bug with onTransitionEnd not being called automatically.  Now onTransitionEnd will be looked for in the space tag or in the spaces tag at the end of the transition.  If you are manually calling onTransitionEnd via transition="tween:... then do tag.onTransitionEnd", then you will have onTransitionEnd called twice.  Just FYI.

rev 98
PanoSalado: Fixed bug with materialslist and videostreammaterials.

rev 96
PanoSalado: Added VideoStreamMaterial, updated Papervision source to most recent rev.

rev 95
Added Video.

rev 94
PanoSalado: added GeodesicSphere Class.  XML tag is <geodesicSphere>.  Geodesic Spheres handle image distortion better than the "normal" sphere in papervision because all of their triangles are more uniform.  However, there is still very significant distortion at the poles, but arguably less and the equator is definitely less distorted.

rev 93
PanoSalado: changed XML syntax for cube objects: file tags need attribute named, "face" instead of "id".

rev 92
PanoSalado: updated QTVR functionality.  qtzrparse.php is deprecated.  PSQTVRParse.php and PSQTVRPreviewParse.php are the replacements.

rev 91
PanoSalado: Moved the setting of viewport.interactive into setupViewport function and out of onAllLoaded.

rev 90
PanoSalado: implemented cylinder autoFOV attribute, which will automagically determine the correct vertical FOV of a cylinder if autoFOV="true" otherwise those values would have to be set manually in the space tag.

rev 88
PanoSalado:  fixed math to size cylinder height appropriately.

rev 84
Refactored qtzrparse and PanoSalado's QTVR display routine, since triangles were getting culled around the edges.  All better now.

rev 81
QTVR parsing works!!, and couple of minor updates to PanoSalado.

rev 80
Many changes:
Flex Interface: renamed, resizing mostly fixed.
PanSalado: added getSpacesAndLabel, supports manually sized and placed viewports.
Updated BitmapMaterial.

rev 78
Example of how to use event.stopImmediatePropagation() to stop events from bubbling to the stage when a MOUSE_DOWN event occurs on an interface button.

rev 77
Bugfix:  Flex interface was not passing mouse events due to PS checking to see if the mouse event target was ViewportBaseLayer.  Removed check, need to add in a check to see if the mouse event originates in Flex and if so, if it is the Application or a child control and allow if it is Application.

rev 76
Experimental:  Created a Flex MXML userInterface template example.  KNOWN PROBLEM: mouse events are not registering in any layers underneath the Flex application crippling all MouseEvent driven functionality in other layers.

rev 75
New features: 
Added cylinder support (needs testing for height, alignment of texture, and texture reversing (to see the inside NOT flipped);
Added support for a CustomActions class which would be loaded as a layer and would contain public static methods for use as user definable custom AS3 native functions to be executed from the XML (like loadSpace in PS e.g., but compiled into a modular swf).

rev 73
cameraRetainsLastValues="false" and <space ... pan || tilt || zoom || focus  now works.  (this is in addition to cameraPan, cameraTilt, cameraZoom, and cameraFocus, which all worked fine before).

rev 72 - 66
Various tween functionalities for PanoSalado XML

rev 59
PanoSalado tween method:  can tween camera, viewport, or any DisplayObject3D using simple syntax and can string a sequence of movements together or simultaneously.
PanoSalado executeXMLFunction method: can execute a "xml function" (not actionscript, just things like loadSpace:.. or tween:...)

rev 58
Implemented useHandCursor and tooltip on objects in XML.  For tooltip to work, UserInterface, or some other swf has to be listening for BroadcastEvent.SHOW_TOOLTIP and take the appropriate measure to display the tooltip.
LayerEvent class has now been included in BroadcastEvent class.

rev 57 - 1
